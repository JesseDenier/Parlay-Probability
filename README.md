# Parlay-Probability

A website where users can enter their potential NBA parlays to see the estimated chance it will hit.

## Description

Fetching from the free API "BallDontLie," this site checks recent statistics of chosen players and estimates their chance to go over/under a chosen value.

This webpage can be opened and interacted with immediately. Choose how many legs your parlay will have by removing legs using the "In Use" toggle, then enter all the information requested and click "Calculate Percentage." Finally when your full parlay is built click the "Calculate Total Percentage" button to figure out if it's a good bet or not.
